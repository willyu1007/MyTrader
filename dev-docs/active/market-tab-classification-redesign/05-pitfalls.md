# 05 Pitfalls (do not repeat)

This file exists to prevent repeating mistakes within this task.

## Do-not-repeat summary (keep current)
- Do not merge `tab` semantics into `marketScope`; keep classification and source dimensions separate.
- Do not silently auto-switch tabs/scope when data is empty; show explicit empty-state reasons first.
- Do not hide manual filters when introducing tabs; users need an override path.
